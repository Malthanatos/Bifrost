# Bifrost


Requires:

Python 3.3+, Natural Language Toolkit for Python (NLTK), XLRD and openpyxl for Python (reads and writes Excel files)

Recommended for full functionality: Numpy for Python, Matplotlib for Python

Use:

Download the repo and install the recommended Python packages using PIP or an alternate installer

Run Python in a shell and import run.py

Bifrost will provide instructions and a list of commands on startup

Running a selected command will provide the user with instructions specific to that command and will execute when given valid input/s

A second branch is available that only includes the polysemy and mindepth related functions

Reduced Bifrost commands:

output - change type of output between shell text and external documentation

polys - polysemy rating for a selection of words

mindep - mindepth of word/s (first result only, see dtree for alternate synsets)

pol_min - runs both polysemy and mindepth analysis of a selection of words

dtree - depth tree of a given word (working on making it neater)

q - quit

We extracted a total of 174,487 definitions. We tabulated these unique senses and meanings to establish two measures: in part of speech senses and meanings (IPOSSAM) and the across part of speech senses and meanings (APOSSAM). For example, the word phone has two entries, one with the part of speech of noun and the other with the part of speech of verb. Phone has three noun definitions and only one verb definition. The APOSSAM value for phone on both entries is 4 (3 + 1), and the IPOSSAM value for phone as a noun is 3 and as a verb is 1. We recoded two WordNet part-of-speech labels (adjective and satellite adjective) as adjectives.
